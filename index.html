                        In the University of the Philippines Diliman, I learned to discover and express myself more and garner friends from all walks of life. I also learned how to value every second that I have and how to calculate the shortest path to where I will be running to get to the next subject.  To put it simply, there are many things I learned from here even at just a short time and those that I mentioned are just a few of them. This is the reason why I love the place.

                        Facing the Sun’s scorching heat, we still continued without any thoughts of escaping it just to fulfill our duty of portraying a scene of a bunch of kids running happily in the Academic Oval for a countdown video clip with regards to the Great Freshie Tour event. There I learned how to act the opposite of what I am really feeling. But then when I saw the video in the internet, I quickly noticed that the scenes we made are all gone and what was left is just the final jump scene we made. For me, I felt no disappointment, for I gained there new friends and one of the important values in life: you should know first what you are dealing with before agreeing into it.

                        Known to be much more athletic and fierce than what she seems to be. With her mean-looking eyes and a seemingly fragile body agreeing on the stature of a witch. It is of no doubt that most people will be afraid at the first time of meeting her. Me and my classmates was then leaded by Ma’am Caces to the room where no weak man is allowed and all the past useless emotions of those who have entered from it are already thrown out and gone. In the Weights Training Room, I learned that I have a weak body and that I am just barely meeting the requirements of the exercise program given by her.  I also discovered there how to push myself to my final limit and exceed it if I can. For now, I can say that my thoughts about Ma'am Caces are ironic to the apparent thoughts of almost everyone for her. She is still strict for me but I think it is with a reason and that is for her exercise program to work. What differs is that for me, Ma’am is really caring because of the fact that she allows us to work with the load that is just right with respect to our current body mass and that she sometimes gives us valuable advice on how to keep ourselves physically fit and healthy.

                        For two days every week at a period of ten to fifteen minutes, I have been running from the National Institute of Physics to Palma Hall for I have a contiguous class on both buildings with no time break between them. Sometimes I run straight up to Benitez Hall and then I will turn left after reaching it. Other times it was in the Engineering Library 2 and turning right after reaching it. But on one day, it was different, It was raining very hard and I soon find myself just obeying to go to where my umbrella was driven by the wind. I saw a Toki jeep and asked to the driver if the path that he will be taking will take me to Palma Hall immediately. Unfortunately, he said no. I gasped, while thinking on what kind of student am I, not knowing the travelled path of the only means of transport available on my school. A thought then suddenly struck me, what if there is a shortcut path on these two buildings and that it is just due to my lack of experience and knowledge that keeps me from knowing it. As I become more observant on where the other people go, I saw people going to the left side of the Institute of Biology, I asked someone, if there is a path in there. He said there is and it will lead me near Palma Hall. It was the garden which is known to be the place where our university’s biologists most often go. The garden’s soothing company captivates people to just lie in its hands and for a moment enjoy nature as it is but for me this place is memorable because it is the path that I should have had walked through since the start of the class if only I looked harder and longer.

                        The sky is clear yet it gives me a sign due to its tinted dark blue color that it is about to rain. It was the day that Manix Abrera launched an exhibit regarding his new book entitled “14” at the Vargas Museum. Manix is an alumni of University of the Philippines Diliman and currently taking a Master degree in Fine Arts in the same said university. In the exhibit he tackles the feeling of longing, wanting to be cared at and wanting to belong using short story-like transition comic strips as his medium.  The work of Manix on that day was a lot different from what I read in his previous works which is about interlaying humour with social issues. It was reality that he portrayed and mixes it up with a strange twist by using mythical creatures that some of us are afraid of as the characters in the story. He bravely puts himself in the shoes of those mythical creatures on what they will feel if they were abandoned just because they are different from which they didn’t even decide it for themselves. I was deeply moved by the story he conveyed and made me reflect on how lucky I am to have all these people loving me.

                        It was the day that I first met this place, I was with my Father and we mistakenly assumed it to be the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Institute because they were on the same road and looks like it. It was actually a few more walks far. When we saw it, I was shocked because the entrance of the unsaid place is elevated so high from the ground. As soon as we entered the building, we were greeted by smiling staffs. It was the Open House Event where the professors and students from the department explained to us students what life in UP is going to be and to our parents what the benefits are if their son/daughter will be going to UP.  The place is the UP Diliman Department of Computer Science. There were three things I remembered that were on my mind that day. First is that the room where the event took place is like the coldest place I've been at so far. Second is that I should always do my best, for life in DCS and UP in general―as they said―is very challenging and hard. Lastly is that I should also have fun at the same time here in UP.

                    I know how to touch the floor of a steep swimming pool with my hands. My whole family and I eat unripe mangoes with vinegar as its condiment because they complement each other very well at least for us. I still drink milk in the morning occasionally. I have borrowed more than 10 books in the Engglib2 Library and on one time I forgot to check a book's return date and so I didn't return that book right on time. So yeah! Bye bye "most-borrow award".
